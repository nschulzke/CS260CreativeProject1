          <h2>What is a conlang?</h2>
          <p>
            The word conlang stands for <strong>Con</strong>structed <strong>Lang</strong>uage.
            A conlang is a language that is designed and created, as opposed to one
            that organically develops. These languages can be designed for fun, or
            to serve a purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the most prominent examples of conlangs are used in fictional worlds. These
            include Tolkien's Elvish languages of Quenya and Sindarin, as well as
            Star Trek's Klingon lanugage. Conlangs have recently featured in movies
            and TV series as well, including languages by David J. Peterson in Thor
            2: The Dark World and Game of Thrones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Constructing a language involves designing its phonology (sounds), lexicon (words),
            and grammar. Optionally, some language creators (such as Tolkien) also
            design writing systems for their languages. There's a great introduction
            to language creation called The Language Construction Kit,
            by Mark Rosenfelder.
